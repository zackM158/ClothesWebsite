This is an e-commerce clothes website that I made for my final project during training.

In the “ZacamoCodeFirst” solution, you may have to change the connection string in the app config file to the name of your sql server.

Run “update-database” from the “Data Layer” project in the Package manager console.

If you change the connection string, you will have to update this in the web and app configs in the “ZacamoWcf” and “ZacamoMvc” projects.
